CCND(1)
=======

NAME
----
ccnd - CCNx Daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnd* [-h]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ccnd* is not normally executed directly. Use *ccndstart(1)* to run an
instance of ccnd. *ccnd* normally runs indefinitely.  Use
*ccndsmoketest(1)* to terminate a *ccnd* (or use *kill(1)*).

*ccnd* is the software forwarder/router for CCNx and is required for
normal CCNx protocol communication.  The typical configuration is to
run one *ccnd* on each host; applications running on the host will
communicate through the local *ccnd*, and it will communicate over
attached networks (directly or through a link adapter process).

*ccnd* takes no options on the command-line. Basic options are controlled
by environment variables. The forwarding table (FIB) is populated with
registration protocols over CCNx.  Use *ccndc(1)* for configuring the
FIB.

*ccnd* communicates via the CCNx protocol running over UDP, TCP, or
Unix domain sockets (the latter for local processes only). It also
provides a simple web status view over HTTP, on the `CCN_LOCAL_PORT`.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
	Print a usage message describing environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

Options for *ccnd* are set via environment variables. 

    CCND_DEBUG=
      0 - no messages
      1 - basic messages (any non-zero value gets these)
      2 - interest messages
      4 - content messages
      8 - matching details
      16 - interest details
      32 - gory interest details
      64 - log occasional human-readable timestamps
      128 - face registration debugging
      bitwise OR these together for combinations; -1 gets everything
    CCN_LOCAL_PORT=
      UDP port for unicast clients (default 9695).
      Also listens on this TCP port for stream connections.
      Also affects name of unix-domain socket.
    CCN_LOCAL_SOCKNAME=
      Name stem of unix-domain socket (default /tmp/.ccnd.sock).
    CCND_CAP=
      Capacity limit, in count of ContentObjects.
      Not an absolute limit.
    CCND_MTU=
      Packet size in bytes.
      If set, interest stuffing is allowed within this budget.
      Single items larger than this are not precluded.
    CCND_DATA_PAUSE_MICROSEC=
      Adjusts content-send delay time for multicast and udplink faces
    CCND_KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY=
      Directory readable only by ccnd where its keystores are kept
      Defaults to a private subdirectory of /var/tmp
