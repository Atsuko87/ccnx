CCNC(1)

NAME
----
ccnc - a simple community text chat program

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnc* 'chatroomuri'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnc* utility is a text-based community chat program.

A "chat room" argument (a ccnx URI) is used to identify the channel.
All of the participants must use the same uri.

If standard input and standard output are both tty devices,
a simple line editor is provided.

As is the case for all ccnx applications, a ccnd must be running on each
machine, and suitable forwarding rules must be configured.
Please refer to *ccndstart(1)* and *ccndc(1)* for details.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

*CCNX_DIR=_/path/to/identity/directory_*::
    If you wish to use an identity (public key) other than your default,
    create one and set CCNX_DIR before starting *ccnc*:
-------------------------------------------
mkdir -p /var/tmp/friendlyname
ccninitkeystore /var/tmp/friendlyname
export CCNX_DIR=/var/tmp/friendlyname/.ccnx
ccnc ccnx:/ccnx.org/chat
-------------------------------------------

BUGS
----
There is no implementation of "friendly names", as used by *ccnchat(1)*.
Instead, there is a display of a few leading hex digits
of the publisher public key digest (aka "robot name").
(Some may consider this a feature rather than a bug.)

There is inadequate notification if no other participants are present.
(Typed lines will simply appear to vanish).

The diagnositics are too cryptic.
