ccndstart - Start ccnd in the background and set up forwarding according to configuration

*ccndstart*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccndstart* utility starts ccnd in the background.  *ccndstart* looks for configuration information in $HOME/.ccnx/ccnd.conf, if there is a configuration file there, *ccndstart* will set up forwarding.  If *ccnd* is already running, *ccndstart* will restart *ccnd*, any forwarding manually configured (with *ccndc*) will need to be re-executed.  *ccndstart* will start using default values for 'CCND_CAP', 'CCND_DEBUG' and the default local port 9695 for 'CCN_LOCAL_PORT'.  These environment values can be set to change the cache size, *ccnd* logging level and local port number.
