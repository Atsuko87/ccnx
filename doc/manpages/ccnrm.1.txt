CCNRM(1)
========

NAME
----
ccnrm - Mark as stale any locally cached content objects matching the given prefixes. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnrm* [-o 'outfile'] 'ccnxname' ['addlnames']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnrm* utility marks matching content objects that are stored in the local *ccnd* cache stale.  This removes them from the cache so they cannot be used to satisfy interests.

The objects that are marked stale can be written to an output file with the '-o' option.

The 'ccnxname' and any additional 'ccnxname' prefixes must follow the CCNx name conventions.  ('addlnames' are optional additional prefixes to mark stale.)


OPTIONS
-------

*-o* 'outfile'::
     This option writes out the newly stale content objects to a file.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; retrieval error)
