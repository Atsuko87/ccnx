This directory contains man page documentation for tools.  

The source is asciidoc. The derived formats are HTML, PDF, and man
page.

Note that even with asciidoc you may be missing the required xmlto
program because of poor asciidoc package dependencies and the
diagnostics in this case are not very helpful.
