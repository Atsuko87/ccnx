== Name

Name ::= Component*
Component ::= BLOB
.......................................................
A Name element simply contains a sequence of *Component* elements.
Each Component element contains a sequence of zero or more bytes.
There are no restrictions on what byte sequences may be used,
so when displayed as xml, a base64Binary encoding may be needed.
When the bytes happen to be printable UTF-8, a more human-friendly "text"
alternative is available (although this is not shown in the official schema).
There is also a "hexBinary" available.

The Name element in an *Interest* is synonymous with the
terms 'prefix' and 'name prefix'.

The Name element plays a pivotal role in both the
link:InterestMessage.html[Interest] and
link:ContentObject.html[ContentObject] element.
