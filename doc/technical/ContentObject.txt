CCNx Content Object
===================

== Source references
link:xsd.html[ccnx.xsd] is the xml schema that describes what the xml rendition of ccn data (including ContentObject messages) should look like.

link:xsd.html[ccnx.xsd] is a dtd that should describe the same, in a less strongly-typed fashion.

link:DTAG.html[tagname.csvdict] contains the mapping between the DTAG values used in the binary encoding and the element names used in the XML representation.

Below we will use a less formal abstract syntax to indicate how the pieces fit together.

== ContentObject
.......................................................
ContentObject ::= Signature
                  Name
                  SignedInfo
                  Content
.......................................................

The ContentObject element represents some arbitrary binary data
(held in the Content element) together with its link:Name.html[Name], some
additional bits of information (the SignedInfo), and a digital
Signature of the other three elements.

== Signature 

See the link:SignatureGeneration.html[Signature Specification].

== Name

See the link:Name.html[CCNx Name Specification].

== SignedInfo

.......................................................
SignedInfo ::= PublisherPublicKeyDigest
	       Timestamp
	       Type?
	       FreshnessSeconds?
	       FinalBlockID?
	       KeyLocator?
.......................................................

=== PublisherPublicKeyDigest

The PublisherPublicKeyDigest identifies the publisher that signed this
content.  The value is a SHA-256 digest of the public key of the publisher.

=== Timestamp

See link:Timestamp.html[CCNx Timestamp Specification]

=== Type

The primitive type of the ContentObject *Content*.

[width="90%"]
|=======
| DATA | default when Type element is absent
| ENCR | content is encrypted
| GONE | whiteout marker
| KEY  | public key
| LINK | link
| NACK | no content at this time
|=======

=== FreshnessSeconds 

The optional FreshnessSeconds indicates how many seconds a node should
wait after the arrival of this ContentObject before marking it as
stale.  See link:Staleness.html[Staleness Specification].

=== FinalBlockID

The optional FinalBlockID indicates the identifier of the final block
in a sequence of fragments.  It should be present in the final block
itself, and may also be present in other fragments to provide advanced
warning of the end to consumers.  The value here should be equal to
the last explicit Name Component of the final block.

=== KeyLocator

A KeyLocator tells where to find the key to verify this content.  The
KeyLocator may be be omitted when the signer is really sure that
all parties can find the key by other means.  Name conventions can be used
to find the name of the key for a piece of content from the name of
the ContentObject.

The *PublisherPublicKeyDigest* is used as the fast selector to identify the
signer of the content, not this locator.

.......................................................
KeyLocator ::= Key
	     | Certificate
	     | KeyName
.......................................................

== Content
.......................................................
Content ::= BLOB
.......................................................
