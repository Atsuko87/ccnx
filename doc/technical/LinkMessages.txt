CCNx Link Messages
==================

In some cases it may be advantageous for adjacent nodes to exchange
some extra information beyond the Interest and ContentObject messages
themselves, for the purpose of making the overall operation more efficient.
We call these *link messages*, and describe them here.

== SequenceNumber
.......................................................
SequenceNumber ::= BLOB
.......................................................

The *SequenceNumber* message may be included in a series of messages.
The primary use of this message is when unreliable datagrams are being used as a transport.
Typically, one SequenceNumber message would be included in each datagram,
with the value (intrpreted as a binary number in network byte order) being
advanced by one.
This allows the receiving side to detect gaps in the sequence, an indication
of missing or reordered packets.

The starting value and BLOB size are chosen by the sending side.
The value should to wrap back to zero after the maximum value for the chosen
BLOB size has been reached.
