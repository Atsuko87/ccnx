CCNx Link Messages
==================

In some cases it may be advantageous for adjacent nodes to exchange
some extra information beyond the Interest and ContentObject messages
themselves, for the purpose of making the overall operation more efficient.
We call these *link messages*, and describe them here.

== SequenceNumber
.......................................................
SequenceNumber ::= BLOB
.......................................................

The *SequenceNumber* message may be included in a series of messages.
The primary use of this message is when unreliable datagrams are being used as a transport.
The BLOB is interpreted as a binary number in network byte order (i.e., big endian).
Typically, one SequenceNumber message would be included in each datagram,
with the value being advanced by one.
This allows the receiving side to detect gaps in the sequence, an indication
of missing or reordered packets.

The starting value is chosen by the sending side.
The sending side may choose to restart the sequence at a different point.
To minimize confusion, the new origin should differ from the last-used sequence number by a value of at least 255.

The minimum BLOB size is one byte, and the maximum is 6 bytes.

== SequenceAcknowledgement
.......................................................
SequenceAcknowledgement ::= BLOB
.......................................................
The *SequenceAcknowledgement* acknowledges the receipt of a consecutive series of SequenceNumber messages.

The final byte of the BLOB is a count, indicating how many items are in the series.
The leading bytes of the BLOB encode the highest sequence number in the series.
The acknowledged range should not span a wrap back to zero.

The SequenceAcknowledgement message should only be sent when SequenceNumber messages have been received.

A SequenceAcknowledgement is not sent unless there is something else to be transmitted, so except for a few extra bytes they do not cause additional network traffic.

It is allowed for a given sequence number to be acknowledged multiple times (using overlapping ranges), which adds robustness if an acknowledgement is lost in transit.
