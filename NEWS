    machine.

    FinalBlockID where appropriate.
  * Added support for file segmentation convention to ccncatchunks2.
  * Centralized timeout definitions in Java library to SystemConfiguration.
  * Improved VLC plugin, incl. using name "ccnx", supporting versioned files.
  * Small improvements to ContentExplorer such as option to save a
    file to filesystem.

  * Minor changes in build/packaging, Java import list.
  * Fixed varargs handling in C library for C99 compliance and to fix operation on
    FreeBSD/amd64.
  * Auto-generated documentation has been improved, particularly in some Java classes.
  * ccncatchunks2 now produces a summary output.
