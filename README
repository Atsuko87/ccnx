test-repo-initial-read
test-io-with-repo
test-repo-io
test-access-control-with-repo
test-benchmark
test-repo-name-responder
test-protocol-with-repo
test-repo-objects
test-repo-structure
test-enumerated-name-list
test-remote-repo1
test-remote-repo2
test-security-with-repo
test-repo
test-impl-with-repo
test-repo-ccnd-restart
test-repo-initial-policy


Regular javasrc testing can be performed normally.
