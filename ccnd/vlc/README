In order to compile the vlc plugin you will need to install
the vlc and libvlc-dev packages:

# apt-get install vlc libvlc-dev

and make and install the CCN library prior to compiling
the vlc plugin.

The CCN vlc plugin Makefile makes use of the pkg-config info
to locate the necessary vlc include files, and the correct
directory in which to install the vlc access plugins.

Remember that to vlc, a CCN URI starts ccn:///
