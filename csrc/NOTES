@subsection step1 Step 1: 

If we want to refer to the directory ccn/csrc/cmd, with a link to the documentation for the
directory under that text, we would use (at)link cmd ccn/csrc/cmd (at)endlink (like this)
@link cmd ccn/csrc/cmd @endlink
as the reference.  Note that the single word following the (at)link command is the object
reference for the directory as doxygen believes it is named (see the Directories tab in the generated documentation)
