In order to compile the vlc plugin you will need to install
the vlc and libvlc-dev packages.  On Ubuntu Linux, for example,
you can use:

# apt-get install vlc libvlc-dev

On Mac OS X, you can use macports to install VLC:

$ sudo port install VLC

Next you should make the CCN library prior to compiling
the vlc plugin.

$ ( cd ../../src && ./configure && make; )

Two system-dependent makefiles are provided, Makefile.Linux and Makefile.OSX.
Make a symlink that reflects the appropriate one for your system, e. g.

ln -s Makefile.Linux Makefile

The CCN vlc plugin Makefile makes use of the pkg-config info
to locate the necessary vlc include files, and the correct
directory in which to install the vlc access plugins.

Remember that to vlc, a CCN URI starts ccn:///
