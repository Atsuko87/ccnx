In order to build the CCN plugin for Wireshark you will first need to install
and configure a Wireshark source distribution.

Then -- in your wireshark source directory you should make a symlink from
wireshark/plugins/ccn to the ccn/csrc/glue/wireshark/ccn directory
of the CCN distribution.

You'll need to follow the instructions in wireshark file doc/README.plugins
regarding existing Wireshark files that need to be edited to add a new plugin.
