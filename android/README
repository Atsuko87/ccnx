(Please see "Android Build System Notes" below for building CCN for Android.)

Android Apps for CCNx
=====================

CCNx-Android-Services
  This is an Android app that manages the lifecycle of CCND and 
  a REPO as a service.  One can build a standalone application 
  to utlize the CCNx services made available by this application.

CCNx-Android-Lib
  This is an Android library.  It has helpers for the ccnd and 
  repo services, among other things.  No build is done here, as
  Android libraries are included in source form.

Before you use any CCNx library calls:
- Call CCNxConfiguration.config(Context)
- Call CCNxServiceControl.startAll() or startAllBackround()

Once you have configured your environment (config()) and started
ccnd and the repo (startAll()), you can then use the
CCNx library.

Your application needs these permissions:
         # Always need this:
    android.permission.INTERNET

	# If your keystore is on /sdcard
    android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

Important Notes
===============
- User keys are stored in /sdcard/ccnx/user
  Because this is on the SD card, it may become unavailable if you
  plug in your usb and use the SD card for storage.

  The user keystore is on the sdcard so multiple apps from different packages
  can share the same identity.

  If your app wants to use a private keystore, call
 
- Repo directory is /sdcard/ccnx/repo
  See User note about /sdcard

- Ccnd directory is under the apk:
  /data/data/org.ccnx.android.services/app_ccnd

- CCNR (repo2) is set to be the default repo version.  Please see the man pages for CCNR for more detailed information on environment variables and default values.

Android Build System Notes
===========================

The build system is centered on gnu Make.  For Android projects, the
Makefile wraps the ant commands.

The android code depends on ccn.jar, so you must have run make in
the top level directory before building here.

Ccnd and the c-client library require OpenSSL library, which we need
to include build ourselves, as there is no apparent way to use the
included Android library.  As a result, we can use the latest 1.0.0d
library!

You must set the environment variables ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK.
These must point to the root of the SDK Tools and NDK directories.

Supported Versions:
* Android NDK r7
* Android SDK r16

Supported Target Android Devices:
Android 2.1
Android 2.2
Android 2.3
Android 3.x

Newer tablet oriented versions of Android, such as 4.0+ are not supported yet but will be in the near future as build support and toolchains catch up. (Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) has not yet been tested.)

For example (Use the path to desired tools):

	export ANDROID_SDK=~/android-sdk-mac_x86
	export ANDROID_NDK=~/android-ndk-r7

Android is not built as part of the top-level make.  You must run
make in this directory.

What happens
============

When you run "make" in the android directory, the build process takes
these steps:

- Build "external".
  This downloads the OpenSSL source, configures it for armv5, and
  does a patch.  It them puts Android.mk files in to the OpenSSL
  source directories.  There is no actual compiling done.

  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION
  You will need to download openssl-1.0.0d.tar.gz from
	http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.0d.tar.gz
  and put it in the directory external/downloads.

- Build CCNx-Android-Services
  This wraps the ccnd and repo services.  Because ccnd is C code,
  it is included as JNI code, along with OpenSSL.

  Doing a "make clean" will not erase the C object code.  Only
  a "make distclean" will get rid of it.

  The CCNx csrc/ folder now has Android.mk files in it already, so
  the CCNx-Android-Services/jni folder has a link to csrc/.  We have
  also include csrc/ccnd/android_{main,msg}.c.  android_main.c replaces
  ccnd_main.c in Android.mk and is used to startup ccnd procedurally
  rather than from a main() method.  android_msg.c replaces ccnd_msg.c
  in Android.mk and sends ccnd log messages to the Android log.

  Take a look in jni/controller/ctl_ccnd.c for the JNI bindings to
  the ccnd code.

- Build the apps/ directory

Honeycomb
===========
Android 3.x devices (and possibly some 2.x) devices the crypto support includes a subset of the Bouncy Castle library.  See: http://redmine.ccnx.org/issues/100589 for details.  As a result, the 3.x devices we tested failed with ClassNotFoundException trying to resolve the BouncyCastleProvider.  To work around this, we include the Bouncy Castle provider jar file if you specify in the top level of the android project directory:

	make honeycomb

This change affects CCNx-Android-Services, CCNx-Android-Chat, and CCNx-Android-StartupExamples.  Because of the size of the jar file (around 1.5mb) we are interested in a better solution long term, though there is no indication Google has changed their approach, except to enhance the android crypto library to rely upon functionality delivered through OpenSSL.

Installing
===========

"make install" will install the Services and Chat applications.  You
might need to "make unistall" before "make install" if the applications
were previously installed with a different signing key (i.e. you use
the phone with builds from multiple computers).
